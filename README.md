## Deployment Info

Connect to VPS via SSH
- User: strapi-controller
- PW: aBN1fzEutA

Make shure that the ufw firewall settings are correct and the strapi port is open:

```sh
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw allow 1337
sudo ufw allow 3307
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable 
sudo ufw status
```

Now make shure that the mysql 5.7 container is running:

```sh
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker start legacy_mysql
```

If the Firewall is not allowing traffic to the docker container, validate the **/etc/default/docker** file:
If it is not there, add the following line to the mentioned file and restart docker.

```sh
DOCKER_OPTS="--iptables=false"
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
